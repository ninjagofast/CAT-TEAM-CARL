Our problem: Finding a solution to allow for people who are blind/low vision to play ball games without as much reliance of a seeing person
We had these steps while building this project: 1. Interview with Chenggui, talk with Paul
                                                2. Idealization, early development, concept drawings, creating persona
                                                3. New cage (inside small ball), new TPU ball, designed a PCB, ideas on mass production/DIY production
                                                4. Workshop with Chenggui + students
                                                5. Redesigned PCB, redesigned cage, made changes to foam ball for ease of access 
                                                6. Focus meeting with other blind and low vision community
                                                7. Changes in code for the audio of the ball
                                                8. Final presentation
                                                9. IMA Show
